# Sorting-Algorithms
This repository contains info about Sorting Algorithms Fundamentals and their Implementation in Java Programming Language. 

## Fundamentals of Sorting Algorithms:
### Definition of a Sorting Algorithm:
A Sorting Algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of an array in a certain order.
<ul>
    <li>If they are Numbers, then we do numerical ordering.</li>
    <li>If they are Strings, Characters, then we do alphabetical ordering.</li>
</ul>

### Types of Sorting Algorithms:
<b> 1. Comparison Based Sorting Algorithms:</b><br/> 
We use comparison to sort the items.<br/>
Example: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.<br/>
    
<b> 2. Non-Comparison Based Sorting Algorithms:</b><br/> 
We do not use comparison to sort the items.<br/>
Examples: Radix Sort, Bucket Sort.<br/>

### Sorting Algorithms Terms:
<b>Time complexity:</b><br/>
It quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.
<b>Space Complexity:</b><br/>
It quantifies the amount of space or memory taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.
