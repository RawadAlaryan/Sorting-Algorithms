# Sorting-Algorithms
This repository contains info about Sorting Algorithms Fundamentals and their Implementation in Java Programming Language. 

## Definition of a Sorting Algorithm:
A Sorting Algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of an array in a certain order.
*If they are Numbers, then we do numerical ordering.
*If they are Strings, Characters, then we do alphabetical ordering.

## Types of Sorting Algorithms:
1. Comparison Based Sorting Algorithms:<br/> 
We use comparison to sort the items.<br/>
Example: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.<br/>
    
2. Non-Comparison Based Sorting Algorithms:<br/> 
We do not use comparison to sort the items.<br/>
Examples: Radix Sort, Bucket Sort.<br/>

## Sorting Algorithms Terms:
Time complexity: <br/>
It quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.
Space Complexity:<br/>
It quantifies the amount of space or memory taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.
